            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Introductory Remarks.</head>
            <p>FEW Perſons amongſt the mighty numbers that have writ, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn <hi>more the Vanity</hi> of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; tho' I hope as few have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it leſs in <hi>Vain:</hi> The firſt Deſign of my putting Pen to Paper, was only to correct the Licentiouſneſs of Paper and Pen, and to ſupply with a timely animadverſion, the Expiration of a temporary Act; 'twas Time ſure, 'twas high Time for every Loyal Heart to uſe his Ink, when they had almoſt ſcribled us all into Blood; and to weeld his Pen in the defence of the Government, when the Knife was at our Throats, and their Swords drawn: I know the weakneſs of the dint of Argument againſt the power of Steel: And the Impertinence of perſuaſion where the Law can Compel; but ſince the Pen has the power of provoking a Rebellion, and that experienced, 'tis as warrantable an experiment to turn its Point; and make the ſame Wand to lay the Devil that it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and ſince the <hi>Laws</hi> were almoſt ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb facs="tcp:65080:12"/>
only with their threatning <hi>Arms:</hi> 'Twas time to animate the dead Letter: To make it know its force and exert its power; and to ſtrengthen a Government: That ſeem'd but too weak for its ſelf, and unhappily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted its own ſecurity; And that to this purpoſe the power of the Pen has not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, will appear from theſe ſubſequent Obſervations; Which the comfortable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs will better juſtify, than their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Rebellion could have been made again Juſt; and which I'le aſſure you now 'tis ſome. Comfort to obſerve: Eſpecially to thoſe that were ſo bold as to be concerned, that da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſtem the torrent of Schiſm and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when 'twas but a dangerous Duty; and embarqu'd with the Government, in a ſtorm; when the Waves roſe and raged hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>gathering of the People,</hi> was like the <hi>noiſe of many Waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is obſervable that upon the firſt diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the <hi>Weſtminſter Parliament,</hi> that which might be as well called the <hi>healing</hi> one; whoſe ſober debates had ſuperſeded the ſullen unadviſedneſs of the ſubſequent: cloſed the wounds of an Inteſtine War, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Government of Church and State; Compact, and firm; for about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years; beyond what the force of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:65080:12"/>
could devide; or Plot and Treachery undermine; That Parliament which they Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled, Publiſht for Penſionary; only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would not take pay of the People, where perhaps, they would have been truly paid: That Parliament which with regret they call the <hi>long:</hi> And all honeſt Hearts reſent as too <hi>ſhort;</hi> whoſe unhappy diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution rivall'd almoſt the fatality of the late perpetual ſitting; whoſe Prudent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs gave ſome probability of ſounding a Plot: which others inconſiderate raſhneſs hath left without a bottom; if not beyond belief or Foundation, by <hi>proceedings unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable</hi> and bold. 'Tis obſervable, I ſay, that then the Serpent of Sedition, that like the Primitive one was curſt in the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, forc't to creep on its Belly, and crawle upon the Duſt, began firſt to raiſe its Venom'd head; and with audacious Libels, ſpit its Poyſon in the very face of Majeſty: We know we had Plots before, and that <hi>Oats</hi> his too; not as a Diſcoverer, but as prime Rebel, and Conſpirator; not as an infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of Popiſh ones but a Ring-leader of a Republican: we know we had then too our <hi>Tongues</hi> that were hanged for <hi>Treaſon;</hi> as well as thoſe that could ſince get Traytors Hang'd: yet ſtill midſt all thoſe unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:65080:13"/>
attempts to Rebel, Sedition never grew ſo much and ſucceeded, that bleſſed Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of near twenty years quiet, tho' oft endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be interrupted, never afforded ſo much <hi>Treaſon</hi> from the Preſs, as for the laſt <hi>five</hi> years has been Publiſht in their Prints; Libels lookt as if they had been Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed for a <hi>Luſtrum;</hi> and as if the tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Printing Act had expired ſeaſonably, 'twas never <hi>reſolved</hi> amongſt all their <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> to be revived; 'twas oppoſed even when moved, unanimouſly, that <hi>Treaſon</hi> too might be Publiſht with a <hi>Nemine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicente;</hi> 'twas preſumed, I ſuppoſe, the better Pen-men were their own; and I grant them the more peſtilent; that could ſpread their Contagion as faſt as the Plague, and to the Monarchy as mortal; for almoſt <hi>five</hi> years the Diſtemper was Epidemick; and the State <hi>Empericks</hi> had poyſoned the body Politick almoſt beyond the Antidote of true Medicine and Art, it Sympathis'd with Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the Natural, almoſt incurable; reigned moſt populouſly in Towns and Cities; and turned every Corporation into a politick <hi>Peſt-Houſe:</hi> Appeals, <hi>vox Patriae,</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>England;</hi> Fundamental Rights, were expoſed in Capital Letters upon every Stall; and that dedicated to Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
<pb facs="tcp:65080:13"/>
and ſome Penn'd by them too; for the Information of the People; or in a leſs prepoſtorous Phraſe for their Confuſion; Sedition ſeemed to be countenanced with ſuffrages, and ſeconded, as they thought, with the ſupream power of the Nation. They expected Treaſon ſhould have been enacted for Law; and Laws repealed that had declared <hi>High Treaſon.</hi> 'Tis almoſt prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous and incredible, tho' unhappily too true, that more Sedition was fomented from the <hi>diſcovery</hi> of this <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> than all the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in Hell could have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, while yet <hi>undiſcovered,</hi> we forged out one anothers ruin from the very delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and to fall with harder fate the leſs to be lamented; by our ſelvs, and juſt eſcapt the <hi>ſtorm</hi> we ſtrove to periſh more miſerably <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the <hi>Port.</hi> Such was the ſtate of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, when ſome of our Loyal Hearts firſt ventured to ſtem the Tide, the fierce influx of an Impetuous Rebellion; that like a true torrent came rolling on with noiſe and clamor; and threatned ruin from afar: The firſt that oppoſed the Great <hi>Goliahs</hi> of their Cauſe, that defyed too even the Armies of the living God; and the ſtrength of his Anointed; was he who from his Youth had ſerv'd the Crown, with his Pen as well as
<pb facs="tcp:65080:14"/>
his Sword; and before him too did their Dagon fall; one whom they had deſigned formerly for a Victim, when they ſacrificed, their Prince; whom Providence reſerved for their Scourge, and for which ſince ſome of them have publickly curſt its diſpenſation, Libelled him in their Emblematical Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, (in which, I confeſs, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpared their King) breaking his Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter like a Dog, and running for his Life and Neck; and that by the very ſame hands of Villains that had forfeited their own to the Government, and were afterward faſter nooſed.</p>
            <p>How Zealous were our Popular <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots</hi> againſt the leaſt animadverſion that was made on the moſt audacious Libel, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Judges themſelvs arraigned, for daring to execute thoſe Laws, the meaneſt villain, could daily dare to violate: How curious to enquire for the leaſt accuſation againſt the worthy Perſon above deſcribed, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe he dared to do his duty; when 'twas dangerous to do ſo: It was a pretty ſort of expedient, tho the moſt abſurd Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, for the countenancing of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh-Plot,</hi> to bring every one concerned in it, that would not ſwallow the whole <hi>Maſs</hi> of it raw, crude and undigeſted; and that before
<pb facs="tcp:65080:14"/>
they had cook'd it up with Nartative too; while their <hi>Proteſtant</hi> raſhneſs at the ſame time precipitated them but into a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrin, of Reſignation to their Senate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Church, and believing their houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> with a Faith implicite; yet this was all done too, and this Gentleman whoſe Writings only declared him a little ſcrupulous in matters of belief; (when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the moſt credulous in all Ages, it has been allowed to doubt; and by the Great <hi>Des Cartes</hi> the wiſeſt Philoſopher as a ſtep to the knowledg of the Truth.) Him 'twas expedient to <hi>Metamorphoſe,</hi> with the power of an Oath; which was then Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, from an avowd <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> into a profeſt <hi>Papiſt:</hi> I uſe that poetical Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe they might as well have ſworn him through all the transformations of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> into <hi>Bull, Bear; or Dragon,</hi> born a profeſt Son of the Church, conformed through all his Life, to all its Ceremonies; a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for her with his Pen, and with it a publiſht Enemy to <hi>Rome,</hi> even in his own Works; having about him Eyes; Noſe, Ears: And from Head to Foot all the true ſhapes of a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Humane Creature; but the Spell of <hi>Affidavit</hi> beyond that of <hi>Circe,</hi> turned Him all into the Beaſt of
<pb facs="tcp:65080:15"/>
               <hi>Babylon;</hi> all his Hair vaniſht into a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Crown; The Whore came riding on his very back, and the fleecy Cowl of Prieſts came tumbling o're his Shoulders; and the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> he held in his Hand, ran all into red Letters, and the <hi>Maſs-book:</hi> His being a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> was as much credited as the Plot it ſelf; and might have had the Reſolution of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> to the point of his Religion as well as the truth of the Conſpiracy; not a Member but was well ſatisfyed of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, and could Menace him in Publick with a <hi>Topham</hi> or a <hi>Tyburn.</hi> And he the firſt Inſtance, that under a Government yet eſtabliſht, a Religion then Laboured for with Zeal, who for Writing in the defence of both, was forc't to fly for his ſecurity and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, tho as publickly cleared from the perjur'd Accuſation, before his King, before his Council, as good Judges at leaſt as the Credulous <hi>Commons;</hi> theſe careful <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots</hi> being often abuſed by their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, for whom they were ſo Zealous; Oaths, Affidavits, and that <hi>Cloud</hi> of <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> had almoſt obſcured the <hi>light</hi> of Reaſon and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</p>
            <p>Another Worthy Perſon, tho' unknown, that at the ſame time bleſt our Land with
<pb facs="tcp:65080:15"/>
the Benefit of his Pen, while with the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous river he hid his head; whoſe Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dialogues only Corrected their ſawcy Libels; with a ſmile and with a pleaſant reproof of their Falſhoods made them feel the ſmartneſs of his Truth: Him they Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled too for <hi>Popiſh,</hi> Mercenary, Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the Party: So Zealous were they for the ſubverting of the Government, that they could damn all that did but dare to aſſert it; Break the very Laws of ſociety in their Cenſures; and what they could not prove with their <hi>Affidavits</hi> condemn upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
            <p>With what ſawcy; Petulant Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions did they treat the Dean of <hi>Paul's</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Separation; A piece penn'd with that Judgment and Moderation, that it was only envyed for being ſo; commended and applauded by the Pen, even of one of their moſt virulent Scriblers, that had engaged Himſelf for the vilifying of the Church, in which he was Chriſtned; and fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Banner of his Chriſt, for which he had vowed himſelf a Souldier; * And with the ſubtile Inſinuation of righting <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:65080:16"/>
but what Reaſon could not reſiſt, muſt be baffled by a <hi>Buffoon,</hi> and a Pen employed to Burleſque the very <hi>Bible,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than want an anſwer to the <hi>Text;</hi> and the ſacred ſervice of the Church, prophaned <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of Impoſition.</note> with the tropes of <hi>Trinkets,</hi> and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor of an Hobby-horſe; tho upon other Occaſions ſhe can be transformed into the more terrible beaſt of the <hi>Revelations:</hi> The Author was Anonymous, and ſo eſcap't the thanks of the Houſe; but what ever were the ſcurrilous Animadverſions on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and the like Ingenious, Loyal, and elaborate pieces; 'tis obſervable they had ſo much Influence on ſome of our blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Zealots as to open their eyes, brought ſome of their Villanies to <hi>light,</hi> that had been ſo long tranſacted in the <hi>dark,</hi> and drove the Faction to ſtand a little at bay, that had ran the Nation almoſt out of her Wits; coold their brutal Zeal down into Humane Senſe, acquainted them with what was truly Religious, and heartily Loyal, inſtead of a devout <hi>Phrenſy</hi> and a miſtaken Loyalty.</p>
            <p>All that I can arrogate to my ſelf, is but what I ſhall always be proud of, of having done my Duty, and that to my Soveraing, as well as his Subjects, in a ſeaſonable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadverſion

            <p>The fixing of his pitiful and pedantick Terms on the Venerable Gown explains ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently the Veneration he has for the Church, the dulneſs of his Senſe and Stile betrays his very diſſenting from it, and his Ignorance the beſt Evidence of his Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; 'tis the beſt Argument of his abſurdity to talk of their want of being well Educated, who have ſuch Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſo well endowed, for a learned and liberal Education.</p>

And truly in the firſt place all Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians agree that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory was uncertain before the coming of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and without doubt we had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to want the Tradition of it; when needs we muſt, when we had nothing of Learning or Knowledg to deliver it down; unleſs we would imagin the ſilly ſimple Souls could have left us their own Skins for a Chronicle; and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the painted Conſtitution of their Government in the Colours and Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks of their Bodys. But ſince that Author owns, and that from the good Authority he quotes, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it was uncertain; but that they <note place="margin">Strabo, Tacitus, Caeſ. Com.</note> were ſubject to many <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> which laſt Expreſſion I fancy was his own, to make it favour more of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick:</hi> which I am confident they were then as Ignorant of as we, truly now, of <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> which I gather partly from the Conſtitutions of all Nations at this time truly Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: Since both the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> of the uncivilized World confirms the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Hypotheſis, the moſt probable Conjecture, which is all at this preſent governed by its petty <hi>Monarchs,</hi> and

puny <hi>Princes,</hi> tho' ſome greater <hi>Empires</hi> too than any of ours in <hi>Europe,</hi> no ſmall Argument for the Divine Right of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> by its being ſo generally embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced only by the light of Nature, whoſe Creation was, whoſe Subſiſtence is the ſole Care of Divinity it ſelf.

right of Sovereignty, when only capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated to obey; far from tranſmitting to us the frame of their <hi>Monarchy,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they had known the <hi>Egyptian</hi> learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of writing on the Barks of Trees, and made their Libraries of the Groves in which they dwelt: The <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Monarchs</hi> of their Times were wont to frequent thoſe pious places for Worſhip and Adoration; and had a Veneration too without doubt, for thoſe reverend Bards that ſacrificed; but were far I believe from ſubjecting their Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to that Divinely <hi>Pagan,</hi> tho' then the ſacred Juriſdiction; tho' 'tis report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that upon <hi>Caeſar's</hi> invading them, the very power of Life, and Death, and the Puniſhment for all manner of offences; was in their ſacred Breaſt, and ſuch as would not ſtand to their award, were forbidden their Sacrifices: which Interdiction then was the ſame, I believe, in effect, with the modern power of our Church to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate; but beſides another reaſon, and the beſt too, why we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing delivered from thoſe ſacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Religion and Law; why the Hiſtory of thoſe times is ſtill uncertain,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65080:31"/>
and was never tranſmitted, is becauſe they were expreſsly forbidden to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing to Poſterity, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to Books and Letters, tho ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of that ſort of Communicating, muſt be ſuppoſed by that Inhibition to have been Imparted to them from the <hi>Egyptians, Greeks, Romans,</hi> thoſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Climes through which Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Letters had their firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>
               <p>But whether their Ignorance, or ſuch a prohibition were the Cauſes why nothing deſcends to us of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our old <hi>Britains,</hi> 'tis granted by all, and by this Author himſelf, that it was <hi>Monarchical,</hi> that Kings Reigned here <hi>ab origine,</hi> if not <hi>Jure-divino;</hi> Though I look on their Antiquity no ſmall Argument of their Divine Right, and for the probability of their Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Succeſſion, which I inſinuated above, can, I confeſs, ſince we are ſo much in the <hi>dark,</hi> be only gueſſed by the <hi>light</hi> of Reaſon, and that I ſhall make to warrant the Concluſion, from the preſent Practiſe and Conſtitution of all barbarous Nations, where the next of blood ſtill mounts the Throne, unleſs

interrupted by Rebellion, and that's but the beſt Argument of our Author for the Power of his Parliaments; and if only for this <hi>certain</hi> Reaſon, we have more Authority to conclude it was then Haereditary, then he only from the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of the Story, has to conclude it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I ſee no reaſon why his Sentiments ſhould determine other Peoples thoughts, and why we ſhould not think that the following Heptarchy of the Saxons, (tho they had their ſeven Kings) yet ſtill might agree in one rule of Succeſſion, nay tho their Laws were ſo different too as he would inſinuate, which is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to ſuſpect neither; for they being all one Nation, and then but juſt called from their home by our <hi>Britiſh King Vortiger</hi> for his aſſiſtance: may probably be ſuppoſed to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for the Main the general Rules and Laws of their own Countrey; tho when divided into thoſe ſeven King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms they might alſo make a ſort of private by-Laws according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Emergences of particular affairs that occurred in their ſeveral Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65080:32"/>
Can he prove that the Succeſſion of the Saxons in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey was not Hereditary, when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited in their ſmall Dukedom of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein;</hi> and that conſequently they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the ſame ſort of Election, in their new acquired Government here, that they left in their own at home? this he does not undertake to ſuggeſt, becauſe not able to prove, there having been a probable <hi>Monarchy</hi> all along He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary, if Paternal Right was wont to deſcend ſo: for that is proved by moſt learned Pens, and theſe Saxons are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to have been the relict of the race of <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> that inhabited that <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneſe,</hi> ſo called from its Inhabitants, of whom <hi>Gomer</hi> the Son of <hi>Japhet</hi> was the Original <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what ever was their Government before, he allows them to have ſet up ſeven <hi>Monarchies</hi> here: only can't think they <hi>agreed</hi> in one <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Succeſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe governed</hi> by <hi>different Laws,</hi> which tho granted, is ſo ridiculous an Infinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that greater Differences, at preſent, between greater Kingdoms and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, far more remote in Place, far more different in Religion, contradicts the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65080:32"/>
Suggeſtion; who for the moſt part, now over the whole World, agree in an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Succeſſion to the Crown; and the Argument would have been as ſtrong, and as apparently fooliſh (if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd it for a Specimen of his folly,) that ſince <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain, Sweeden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> are govern'd by differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Laws, we can't imagin them to have one <hi>ſort</hi> of Succeſſion: Which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rebound of his own Pen wounds his Cauſe, more than any direct ſtroak of his Adverſaries, for ſince we ſee thoſe more different, more diſtant Nations agree in one Rule, 'tis ſure a Logical Inference <hi>a Majori,</hi> that thoſe that were <hi>leſs</hi> different might.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>Changes</hi> and <hi>Confuſions</hi> of thoſe Times, which he urges as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of their uncertain Succeſſion: that is in effect, his very <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mega;</hi> and his <hi>praefatory</hi> Suggeſtion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved through his whole <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> that in times of <hi>Confuſions</hi> and <hi>Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> Succeſſion is <hi>uncertain;</hi> and ſo is all Property, and Common Right, all <hi>meum,</hi> and <hi>tuum;</hi> all that the Law of God or Man can make his own.</p>

But as obſcure as he makes our Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion before the <hi>Romans</hi> came, 'tis not ſo <hi>dark</hi> and unintelligible, but that we may gather <hi>light</hi> enough from it to have been <hi>Hereditary.</hi> We won't rely on the <note place="margin">

yet we may read too, there were many petty Kings that they ſuffered here after their Conqueſt, it being the <hi>Roman</hi> Pride of having <hi>Kings</hi> their <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi> and why thoſe might not ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an <hi>Hereditary</hi> Succeſſion, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand, eſpecially ſince Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> reckons up 16 Kings that ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded after the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces had left them <hi>naked;</hi> as indeed they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Metaphor to the incurſion of the <hi>Pict;</hi> the firſt five or ſix of them lineally ſucceeding one another from Father <note place="margin">Vid.

becauſe a perfect Excluſion of the right Heir, and the next Lawful Son and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor to their late King: And the Fiction that the Factious Author tells us, of a Child choſen in the Womb, proves but the Story, the Fable of a <hi>Monk;</hi> for which he might as well have cited their <hi>Legends M, Weſtminſter, Paris,</hi> nor any other Authentick Hiſtorians ancient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, ſo much as mention it, and our modern <hi>Baker</hi> ſays expreſly upon <hi>Ethelred</hi>'s Death, <hi>his third Son,</hi> Edmund, <hi>call'd</hi> Iron-Side; <hi>but the Eldeſt living at his Fathers Death ſucceeded, and was Crowned at</hi> Kingſton <hi>upon</hi> Thames; <hi>That</hi> a <hi>great</hi> part <hi>of the Nobility favoured the Dane, becauſe they feared him;</hi> but the <hi>Londoners ſtood firm</hi> to <hi>Edmund, and were the Authors</hi> of his <hi>Election,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his very uſing of the word here, I can't but obſerve, what the worthy Dr. has ſufficiently proved too; how common among Hiſtorians that word Election is uſed only for a Confirmation or acknowledgment of the <hi>Right,</hi> and how againſt Reaſon he ſtill miſapplies it to <hi>Choice:</hi> why did he not undertake to prove from <hi>Baker</hi> too, that this Prince was <hi>elected</hi> by the <hi>Londoners;</hi>

taken for the beſt title, and even in thoſe times had the greateſt Influence, which was the Lord <hi>Stanley</hi>'s Caſe, who tho the very Perſon that plac'd the Crown on this Princes <hi>head,</hi> yet ſuffer'd the loſs of <note place="margin">

               <p>But that which this Hiſtorian might have obſerv'd too, in this Reign as a diſcouragement to the deſigns of ſome of their popular Patriots then afoot, when he pen'd this his preſumptuous piece, was the ill ſucceſs that two ſeveral impoſtures met with in their pretenſions to a Crown to which they were not <hi>born,</hi> no great Inducement certainly for any one to be perſuaded to perſonate the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Heir, to ſet up for a <hi>Lambert</hi> or a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin,</hi> only for their misfortune and fate.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I ſhall conclude my remarks upon this Kings Reign, with an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion upon a Paragraph or two
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65080:74"/>
that conclude his piece, very pertinent to this place, ſince it relates to the times of which we treat; and that is the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Judges, upon the Caſe of this their King; that the Deſcent of the Crown, purged all his defects, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder. This their opinion he refutes <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Brief Hiſt.</hi> p. 17.</note> as <hi>Frivolous, Extrajudicial,</hi> and here <hi>Impertinent;</hi> but I hope to ſhow this Point a moſt material one, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to be a good Judgment, and their reply much to the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſure it was a matter and that of a high Nature to know how he was qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd to ſit in the Houſe, that was to preſide in it as the head: And tho he might in ſome ſenſe be ſaid to have won the Crown with <hi>Arms,</hi> yet he knew it would wear much Better, ſit much Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier, if ſetled, and eſtabliſh't according to Law; and tho a Conquerer that has the Sword in his hand, can ſoon capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate himſelf to ſway the Scepter; yet he'l ſoon find the moſt regular Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings tend moſt to the Eſtabliſhment of his Reign; this made <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh who had a Triple Plea for the Crown, and that one by diſcent from the <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:65080:75"/>
conſult his Oracles of the Law, how far an Attainder paſt in the Reign of the <hi>Yorks,</hi> would ſtill taint his Blood; and make it leſs Inheritable.</p>
               <p>Secondly, their Reſolution that all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding defects were purg'd in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, was a Judgment both equitable, and reaſonable; for 'twas ſure but equal that an Heir to whom an Inheritance and that of a Crown was allowed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend ſhould be qualify'd to take too; for if he was a King, no Bill of Attainder could touch him, that was paſt too when he was none: And if he was no King, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid</hi> Dyer <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>f.</hi> 59. <hi>The King is the head of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons but Members. So no more Parliament without a King, than a body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a head. It is no Stat. if a King aſſent not to it.</hi> 12. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 20.</note> all the concurrence of the Lords and Commons cou'd never have made him an Act for his being ſo; there being no Royal Authority, to paſs it into Law, and nothing by the very conſtitution of our Government can be made a Law without; ſo that ſuch a reſolution cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was highly reaſonable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, that that ſhould purge its own defects which no power had perfection anough to purge; wou'd he have a King paſs an Act with his two Houſes for the reverſal of his own Attainder, or the two Houſes reverſe the Attainder of their King? If the firſt, the allowing him to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65080:75"/>
paſs ſuch an Act, ſuperſedes the end for which it ſhould be paſt, and makes him <hi>de Facto</hi> capable whom they would ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate, if he allows the Latter then he muſt an <hi>Interregnum</hi> too; extinguiſh that Monarchy for a while, of which the very Maxim ſays the Monarch can't dye, and place that Supream power in the <hi>People,</hi> which all our Fundamental Laws have put in the King.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this Reſolution is very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the preſent purpoſe to which 'tis commonly now apply'd; and that is the <hi>Bill of Excluſion:</hi> But his paſſion, and prejudice; would not permit him to Examin the little difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
               <p>For certainly that ability that can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge any attainder, is as efficacious for the voiding and nulling any Bill that ſhall hinder the deſcent for a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, would have been but a Bill or an Act of the Houſe for diſabling the next Heir; And an Attainder can do the ſame; and is as much the Houſes Act; and to diſtinguiſh that in an Excluſion the Diſcent it ſelf is prevented by a Law, makes juſt no difference, for whoever is Attainted has his Diſcent prevented
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65080:76"/>
by a Law too, and that antecedently alſo, before the Deſcent can come to purge him; ſo that they only differ in this formal ſort of Inſignificancy, In an Excluſion, the Diſcents prevention would be the ſole Subject of the Bill, in an Attainder it is by Conſequence and Common Law prevented, and ſo the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability being but the ſame in both, the defects by the ſame means may and muſt be purged.</p>
               <p>The preſident the Judges cite to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy <note place="margin">1. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>f.</hi> 4. B.

Caſe as an Attainder; but was Correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the reſt, and told that he was not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, but Diſabled to hold the Crown, but even that that was void aſſoon
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65080:76"/>
as he came again to wear it; and ſeem to conclude that then <hi>à fortiori</hi> that an Attaindere would be purg'd away by the Deſcent; and ſure if this was then Law, and that even for the Line of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who had <hi>Defects</hi> of <hi>Title</hi> to be purg'd beſides of <hi>tainted blood:</hi> 'Tis ſtrange to me why a <hi>York</hi> now, and ſuch an one too; in whom both thoſe ſo long diſputed Titles Terminate and Concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhould be <hi>Diſabl'd</hi> for ever by that Expedient, which was reſolv'd unable to prevent the Succeſſion ſo long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</p>
               <p>For Argument that an Attainder hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Crowns Diſcent, has this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptious Interpreter of the Law brought the moſt impertinent piece of Application, that the defect of ſenſe could ſuggeſt, and ſo has as little reaſon, as Truth, to tell us that this Judges Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution <note place="margin">

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65080:77"/>
becauſe <hi>John</hi> is ſaid to make over his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the <hi>Moor,</hi> we are all now Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the King of <hi>Morocco;</hi> the true reaſon of the <hi>French</hi> mans ſending of his Son, is what will at any time incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Crowns Diſcent, and that is the Rebellion of the Subjects, and yet thoſe very Barons that Rebell'd never inſiſted on his corruption of Blood, never made it ſo much as a Plea for their Rebellious Inſurrection; nay themſelves thought him ſo far from being diſabl'd by it, that they prefer'd him even to the very right Blood, which was incorrupted in his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Arthur;</hi> but allowing it then Law, this reſolution that ſuch Corruption is purg'd, was made long ſince, and muſt now be as Legal, tho the Contrary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had been never ſo much Law, ſo that here he has only taken the pains to be impertinent and that too for the tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a Lye.</p>
               <p>But as his Villanous heart, had falſely forg'd before that the Learned in King <hi>John</hi>'s time invited <hi>Lewis</hi> over only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought his Attainder had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitated him to take the Crown: when all the while they made nothing but their <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65080:77"/>
the pretence for their Rebellion, and would have been certainly glad of ſuch a ſuggeſtion, when they were ſo well Reſolv'd to Rebel, (tho I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Inviting in of the <hi>French-man</hi> rather as a Retribution of a Remarkable Providence, that retaliated on his head the ſame ſufferance from his Rebel Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which his Soveraign and own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ſuffered from himſelf as Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious a Son, who ſided againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the Second with <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France</hi> the Succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſor of a <hi>Lewis,</hi> as theſe did with a <hi>Lewis</hi> a <hi>Philips</hi> Succeſſor.) With the ſame falſehood and forgery would he have the world believe that the Line of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> was ſo long approv'd, only becauſe that of <hi>Yorks</hi> was Attainted; which when purg'd in Parliament, he ſays, they then preſently forſook the <hi>Lancaſtrian:</hi> But if he pleaſes to Conſult my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> he'l find that Learned Hiſtorian <note place="margin">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65080:78"/>
Obedience, muſt be what is paſt into an Act too; unleſs one of their <hi>Order'd</hi> and <hi>Reſolv'd</hi> ſhall reſolve it ſelf into a Law, for ſuch a Statute muſt, (tho it were for the declaring an Heir Apparent to the Crown,) have the Royal Sanction of ſome Lawful King, which could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be Conſiſtent here, with this their moſt inconſiſtent Declaration; for the granting the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to be their Heir Apparent, in the ſame Breath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth an Uſurper; and the very words that declar'd <hi>York</hi> an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Heir. made him <hi>de facto</hi> their Lawful King; for they muſt either allow that he was the Crowns Heir, and then that had devolv'd to him long before by Blood and Inheritance from <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> Elder Brother to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> from whom the <hi>Lancaſters</hi> claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or elſe they declared their <hi>Lineal, Lawful</hi> King, an <hi>Intruaers, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers</hi> Heir it is an unavoidable Dilemma; if the firſt, then an acknowledgment, of an <hi>irreparable wrong,</hi> done to their Lineal Soveraign that had an <hi>unqueſtionable right,</hi> if the Latter then moſt abſur'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory in making him an Heir to the Crown from that <hi>Henry,</hi> that himſelf

never had the leaſt Title to the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>From whence I conclude, that any ſuch ſuppoſed <hi>Act</hi> (and it muſt be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that if not an Act that then it ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing too,) that purged <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> from his Attainder, could never have the <hi>Royal</hi> Aſſent, unleſs moſt abſurdly from one that was no King; for either it muſt be paſt by <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and then the thing he paſt un-King'd him; or elſe by the Duke the declar'd Heir, and then but a ſuppos'd Subject in the very Declaration, or rather a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and allow'd King in admitting him to paſs a Bill, and ſo ſuperſeded ſuch a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous and Declaratory Act.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, even in this very point the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Author ſuperſedes the pains of any Loyal pen for the Confutation of the falſe Poſition he would prove, and in the very ſame Paragraph baffles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to prevent an Anſwer, and tells us that Richard <hi>Duke of</hi> York<hi>'s Corruption was purg'd when declar'd Heir Apparent by</hi>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65080:79"/>
all that was his, <hi>his Hereditary right</hi> was ſo rooted in the Peoples Hearts, that it form'd for him an Army, fought for him at <hi>Northampton;</hi> and brought both the Uſurper and his Parliament to a Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for the Crown.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the refuting of his <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> Reaſon, and his <hi>leſs</hi> Law upon the Caſe: And his Hiſtorical Inference that <note place="margin">

               <p>And truly the Caſe will admit of no <hi>better</hi> defence; the <hi>badneſs</hi> of his cauſe can never be made <hi>good,</hi> but with ſuch a Juſtification as is much <hi>worſe.</hi> He veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that Aphoriſm of the Tragedian, that to ſecure your ſelf in your Villanies, you muſt commit more, and 'tis the Politicks too of a <hi>Matchiavel</hi> as well as a <hi>Seneca,</hi> and <note place="margin">Seneca in Traged.</note> this the practiſe now of our preſent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican, who firſt lays you down a Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perhaps truly Treaſonable, and then is

forc't to fly to the Reſolution of Traytors for the defence of the Treaſon; and proves that the Crowns Diſcent does not purge Attainder, becauſe this Parliament of an abſolute Uſurper, rather a pack of Rebels then a convention of States, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd it ſo.

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:65080:199"/>
in ſpight of Providence, to have ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf from the Juſtice of that which was <hi>eſtabliſhed;</hi> and at the ſame time made ſure of the favor of thoſe that were for undermining it. The one was to be blinded with his being Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s <hi>Right:</hi> The other impoſed upon with his Penning the <hi>Poſtſcript.</hi> But however he deceives himſelf, the Almighty will ſtill make good his own Word, That he won't be <hi>mock'd.</hi> He has denounced expreſs Judgment againſt a double Heart, and the Nation now deſerv'd Juſtice, To ſuch a Sycophant. With what Face can ſuch a Rumper tell us in the tayl of his Poſtſcript, that no <hi>Paſſion</hi> or prejudice perverts him againſt the State of the Kingdom; when all know that it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus eſtabliſhed, not only loſt him a place in the Law; but diſappointed him of being an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Judge; and thus the virulency of his <hi>Pen,</hi> betrays <hi>the truth</hi> of His <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which he would A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologize againſt with a lye, and that it can riſe as high as any Furies, for as deep a reſentment of an eſteemed Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; when the Government all the while was far from doing him any <hi>wrong:</hi> But
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:65080:200"/>
if it ſhould meet with him now, I dare ſwear would do him <hi>Right:</hi> And this is altogether Reaſonable the World ſhould know, that the beſt of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Male-contents, tho' they ſtrive to palliate their Paſſions and Prejudices againſt their Governors, with a ſhow of being impartial and indifferent; that 'tis but a meer ſhadow to could the Fire that Glows within, while truly ſtill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable, impatient, and impoſſible to be govern'd, and that thoſe that pretend but with Moderation to diſcommend many things in our <hi>Monarchy,</hi> have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them, but the meer Malice and Spirit of <hi>Republicans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this will appear from his very firſt Paragraph that provokes my Pen, He lets us know that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is like to fall into that of <hi>Rome,</hi> * by the unpreſidented folly of ſome of her Sons; Fall, by a <hi>Divine Fate,</hi> (as <note place="margin">pag. 8. 9.</note> he makes his Holyneſs to ſay) for her folly.

And truly, I am ſo far of this Gentleman's
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:65080:200"/>
Opinion, that the good man the Pope may very likely call it a very fooliſh thing, and laugh at the Doctrine of any <hi>Kings Divinity,</hi> that endeavors to ſet himſelf above all <hi>Kings,</hi> ſo that unkind even to himſelf, and his Friends, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters; he unawares ties them up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Tenents of the moſt tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and endeavors with the ſelf ſame Arguments and Objections, to ſet up the <hi>popular</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, that <hi>thoſe</hi> Politicians do the <hi>Papal.</hi> But firſt only let me beg a poſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or two from him that pretends to be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> which an <hi>Infidel</hi> or <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> won't deny, much leſs then one that has the Bible, for an aſſerting its belief, <hi>viz.</hi> 1.

'tis but an Irreligious Preſumption to think the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſhould puniſh his choſen, only becauſe they did not Rebel againſt his Anointed; when that Rebellion even by the ſame ſacred Text is declared worſe than Witchcraft; and that primitive one of <hi>Corah</hi> and his Accomplices was ſo remarkably puniſh'd: But I know theſe Authors will tell us, That <hi>Eliah</hi> deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> notwithſtanding that <hi>Ahab</hi> their King countenanced their Idolatry; That <hi>Jehoida</hi> the Prieſt ſet <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> on the Throne, and not only rebelled againſt his Mother <hi>Athalia,</hi> but deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to reſtore the Worſhip ſhe had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh'd: But in both theſe Inſtances they may do well to conſider: 1. That what was done here was by the expreſs Direction of the true Spirit of God in his Prophets; to which when our inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Enthuſiaſts, our Oracles only of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, can prove their right, as well as they but pretend it; they ſhall be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter qualified to Judge their <hi>King</hi> when he offends againſt the Laws of his <hi>God.</hi> And
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:65080:273"/>
does not the Text tell us upon theſe very Occaſions always, <hi>That the Word of God came to his Servants:</hi> 2. <hi>Athalia</hi> here, whom the People reſiſted, depoſed, and ſlew, had no Title to the Crown, but what ſhe waded through in the Blood of all the ſeed Royal: Religion was not there the riſe of the Rebellion, but the right of the Crown's Heir, which was in the young King <hi>Joas,</hi> whom they ſet on the Throne of his Father <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> and for which Heavens had preſerved him; notwithſtanding the Plot, and Deſign there was to deſtroy him: 3.

               <p>If the People delegate an Original power, and a Natural Liberty to this Parliament; it cannot certainly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended how theſe Parliaments as now conſtituted, could commence by the Grants and Conceſſions of the Prince; and yet all will allow, tho they diſagree in the time, that they did begin at firſt to be ſo Aſſembled by the Bounteous Permiſſion of the King, and that all the Privileges they claim, were the reſult of an entire Favour of the Soveraign, and not the Original freedom of the Subject;
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:65080:317"/>
if they'll call that an Original Power to ſend Repreſentatives, it muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like that Author's <hi>Secondary Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> we ſo lately conſider'd; and that tho they preſcribe to it for this ſeven hundred year, as well as they cannot for above four or five 100, ſtill it will recurr to this, That this firſt power was the Grant of the Crown. And theſe preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as themſelves allow, being when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they begun, the reſult of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns Bounteous Permiſſion; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee why thoſe Immunities may not be reſign'd to the ſame Crown, from which they were once receiv'd, or thoſe Franchiſes (for preſcription it ſelf in this caſe is properly no more) may not be <hi>Abſolutely</hi> forfeited, by thoſe that at beſt can but be ſaid to hold them on Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I know the Common Law Favours a Preſcription ſo far, as in Inheritances, to let it have the force of a <hi>Right,</hi> when their cannot be made out any other Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; but this I look upon to be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature, when the Original of what <hi>they</hi> preſcribe too, by their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions was the Grant of their King, and even this Common Law; commonly in all its Cuſtomary Rules, excepts the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:65080:318"/>

               <p>I urge this becauſe it is both appoſite here, and a Caſe upon our late Elections much controverted, and to ſay as ſome do, That ſuch a Preſcription cannot be forfeited, proceeds from a confounding of the word in this Caſe, with that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, by which ſome of them have a Title to their Eſtate: for their Common Objection about this their Elective pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is, That the King may as well deprive them of their Birth-right: when this their Birth-right might commence by an Original Right, but the Power of this Electing muſt Neceſſarily, and Original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firſt come from the Crown: But yet they know too, that this their very Birth-right, is in many Caſes forfeitable by their own Act to the <hi>Crown;</hi> and for their <hi>Burgage</hi> it ſelf, ſhould we abſtract <note place="margin">

               <p>And here I hope, I have proved it home with a Witneſs, from matter of Fact, as well as the force of Reaſon; that Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi>'s placing his <hi>Original Power</hi> in the People, made it impoſſible to be delegated to the Parliament any longer than juſt as the People pleas'd, that this Poſition made every Member of it dayly run the danger of his Head, and that upon his Foundation 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:65080:324"/>
for any State of Government to be eſtabliſh'd: for to be ſure, the People will ſeldom be any longer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with thoſe Delegates themſelves have empowred; then while they want a Power to re-aſſume the ſame that they delegated, it would puzzle almoſt Arithmetick, and a good Accountant, to tell us how many Revolutions of Government, this confuſed Principle, of perfect Anarchy, confounded us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: This <hi>Original power</hi> was delegated as Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> ſays, to the Parliament, and ſo it was indeed to the Long one in 49: But there you ſee they pull it out of their Hands, and plac'd it in the Rump; but that prov'd at laſt ſo unſavory, they could reliſh it no longer, and ſo the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Power forſooth is reſolv'd into a Council of State, from that it runs into the confiding Men of <hi>Cromwells,</hi> and <note place="margin">Barebones Parliam.</note> then at laſt Centers in the Uſurper him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo that in leſs than three quarters of a year, this Original Power of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was delegated to three ſeveral ſort of Repreſentatives: I need not tell them how the People reaſſum'd it from his Son, and left it juſt <hi>no where,</hi> how the People retriev'd it again, and loſt it they

could not tell <hi>how,</hi> how they recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it from the Committee, to whom it was loſt, and then forc'd to leave it at laſt to him, from whom 'twas firſt taken, their King: But this I hope is ſufficient to ſatisfie any Soul, that this Supream <hi>Power</hi> when plac'd in the People, will be always reſolv'd into that part of it, that has the <hi>Supream Strength:</hi> That this Maxim of Republicans, Rebels againſt the very Parliaments they ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire: That it always ruins the very Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Body of People, in which theſe Democraticks themſelves would place it, and reſolves it ſelf into ſome ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that by force or fraud can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; and this made Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> tell us <note place="margin">Tryal page 33.</note> he call'd <hi>Oliver</hi> a Tyrant, and acted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him too; well might he look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as a Uſurper, that Uſurpt upon their deſign'd Common-Wealth, as well as the Crown: I am much of his Mind, but it was far from the reſult of any Kindneſs to his King: He ſaw his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth could never be founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo falſe a bottom, no, not tho ſhe had been his Darling, and Dutch built; his beloved Low-Countries, laboring under a Magiſtracy, that Lords it with
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:65080:325"/>
as much Power as that from which they were delivered; For this his Original Power of the People muſt be as much delegated to thoſe that govern there, as well as it is inherent in any ſole Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, that is the Governor; neither are any beſides the beſt of their Burghers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Adminiſtration, ſo that even that State that comes neareſt to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, is at laſt but a ſort of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy, which their <hi>Harrington</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dems <note place="margin">Oc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So from what has been premis'd, this muſt be concluded, that ſince we ſee they can't puniſh, or Judge even their own Repreſentatives, only their Suffragans in an houſe of Commons; when they have delegated to them their Original power, (which for once we'l ſuppoſe them able to delegate) much leſs ſhall they their Soveraign, tho they did, as they will have it, confer upon him the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that he has, for the Members of the lower Houſe repreſent only the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Kingdom; whereas the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign

And for the Statute of the 25, which <note place="margin">25.

it; but tells us, that in the beginning the <hi>Fathers</hi> of Nations were then the Kings, and the Eldeſt of Families the <hi>Princes,</hi> and of ſuch an Excellency is its Form, that it is the clear reſult of unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd Reaſon, and moſt agreeable to the ſenſe and ſecurity of Mankind: For as the natural Intellect it ſelf (by which I mean bare humane underſtanding) when, in the infancy of the World, people were guided more by their own Fancies, and the <hi>Paternal</hi> Power, which then was all the <hi>Regal,</hi> from the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs it might be ſuppos'd to have towards thoſe that were their <hi>natural iſſues</hi> as well as their <hi>civil ſubjects,</hi> had indulg'd vice, and been leſs rigorous in Executing impartial <hi>Juſtice</hi> on Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; whereby people were left more at Liberty, I ſay Nature then, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity it ſelf, made them find the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience even of too much Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and made even the moſt <hi>fooliſh</hi> fellows apprehend as well as the <hi>wiſe,</hi> that the Condition of <hi>reaſonable</hi> men would be more miſerable than that of <hi>brute</hi> beaſts; that an Inundation of Anarchy and Confuſion, would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm them more than the firſt Flood,
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:65080:360"/>
Did they not, by a general Conſent, ſubmit to Government, and obey thoſe that were ſet over them to Govern? For they found that when they were moſt mighty to oppreſs, others might in time grow <hi>more</hi> ſo, and do them as much miſchief: And thoſe that were <hi>equal</hi> in their ſtrength, found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>equally</hi> dangerous and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous one to another; and that the moſt unbounded Licenciouſneſs prov'd always, to ſome or other, the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Bondage and Slavery.

<pb n="660" facs="tcp:65080:361"/>
only a Licenſe to do what they liſt, and ſo left nothing to be <hi>wrong:</hi> So the ſame reaſon ſuggeſted, that theſe their <hi>Rights</hi> were beſt defended, and ſooneſt decided by ſome ſingle Perſon, that was Supreme, than when a Multitude had the Supremacy; for in that there being ſo many ſuffrages as there are men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly there might be ſo many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intereſts and factions; which muſt both hinder any ſudden determination, as well as make the ſentence liable to more partiality and injuſtice, when it is determin'd. This made the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo tedious always in its deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and the people as uneaſie and unſatisfied in their Decrees: Their <hi>Praetores, Quaeſitores, Judices Quaeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onum &amp; ſelecti,</hi> ſome of them having under them no * leſs than an hundred <note place="margin">Sigon. <hi>de Jud. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp; de Jure Rom. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 18.</note> Commiſſioners, might be ſaid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Cauſes inſtead of determining them. Their <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws that were made for the Diviſion of their Fields, moſt of them having been <hi>given</hi> by <hi>Romulus,</hi> and the reſt of their Kings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd their rights to <hi>them</hi> with <hi>Juſtice</hi> and ſatisfaction to the people, while their Kings Reign'd that <hi>gave</hi> them, and
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:65080:361"/>
were the ſole Judges of their own Laws.</p>
               <p>But when they were confounded into a Commonwealth, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſet themſelves to decide the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of their Commons, and their Fields; what Seditions, Confuſions, and Unſettlement did they create? So that the <hi>Reaſonable</hi> preſumption there is, of a more Equitable and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſtribution of Juſtice from a ſingle Sovereign, becauſe ſuppos'd to be leſs prejudic'd, and leſs unable to be prevail'd upon by favour or affection, may very well be thought to have recommended at firſt, a Monarchical Form, &amp; afford us now aſmuch reaſon for the retaining it.</p>
               <p>In the next place, A King being a perpetual Heir to the Crown, inſomuch that the Politick Laws ſuppoſe him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to dye, and when in a natural ſenſe he does, the Crown ſtill deſcends to his immediate Succeſſor: This will make him endeavour to preſerve the Rights of it inviolate, and perpetuate the ſame Prerogative to his Poſterity: Whereas the people, in all their popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sway, adminiſter only for <hi>years,</hi> or at moſt for Life; and what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them then from defrauding that
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:65080:362"/>
Publick, whoſe Adminiſtration they muſt either ſoon quit, or at laſt leave to thoſe to whom they no way relate. I allow in moſt ſuch Communities, there is commonly ſpecial proviſions made by their Laws, that an abuſing that power, with which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, or a robbing the Common-wealth of part of its Revenue, ſhall be puniſh'd with ſome grievous Fine, or perhaps made Capital; for which the <hi>Romans</hi> had their ſeveral rules and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations for their Magiſtrates and men in Office: But there being ſo many ways to be injurious to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that can ſo eaſily, by thoſe that adminiſter its affairs, be kept private and conceal'd; it muſt certainly be concluded, that thoſe that have an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Power of Publick Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as all <hi>Kings,</hi> and they alone have, that their <hi>Intereſt</hi> obliges them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve its rights inviolate, from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs, that nature it ſelf will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant in them, to injure their own Sons, Succeſſors and Poſterity.

their Common Goal, knock off the Shackles of thoſe that were in it, and ſo ſend them to their ſeveral Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. The like happen'd at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> upon the Execution of one <hi>Fabricius</hi> a Prieſt. From theſe principles it was, that about the Year 1565, that theſe <hi>Hollanders,</hi> 9 of their <hi>protesting</hi> Lords, not at all Officers of State, conven'd at <hi>Breda,</hi> drew up a form of an <hi>Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,</hi> which they call'd too, their <hi>Covenant</hi> (and what has been ſince ſo well copy'd by our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rebells) which they all Subſcrib'd, and ſent about by their Emiſſaries, through all the ſeveral Provinces for Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And as from theſe Principles, theſe Tumults and Diſorders; Leagues and Covenants were created in the Low Countries: So followed alſo from them, an entire Defection from the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and a Rebellious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the United <hi>Netherlands.</hi> For though Mr. <note n="†" place="margin">
